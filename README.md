Welcome to the **Get Next Line** project! This repository challenges you to implement a function that retrieves the next line from a file descriptor each time it is called. This project enhances your understanding of dynamic memory management, string manipulation, and efficient input/output operations in C.

## Introduction

The **Get Next Line** project is designed for students at the 42 School. It focuses on creating a function that reads from a file descriptor, handling dynamic buffers and static variables. This project reinforces skills in memory control and string manipulation, which are essential for efficient programming in C.

## Features

- **Dynamic Buffer Management**: Efficiently handle memory allocation and deallocation.
- **Static Variable Handling**: Understand the use of static variables in C.
- **String Manipulation**: Work with strings to extract lines from a buffer.
- **Efficient I/O Operations**: Utilize the `read()` function for reading data.
- **Low-Level Programming**: Gain experience with file descriptors and system calls.

## Installation

To get started with the **Get Next Line** project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jhonnyMena/Get_Next_Line.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Get_Next_Line
   ```

3. Compile the source files using `gcc`:
   ```bash
   gcc -o get_next_line get_next_line.c
   ```

4. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to execute the compiled file.

## Usage

To use the `get_next_line` function, include the header file in your C program. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```c
#include "get_next_line.h"

int main() {
    int fd = open("example.txt", O_RDONLY);
    char *line;

    while ((line = get_next_line(fd)) != NULL) {
        printf("%s\n", line);
        free(line);
    }
    close(fd);
    return 0;
}
```

This example opens a file called `example.txt`, reads each line using `get_next_line`, and prints it to the console.

## Functionality

The core function, `get_next_line`, operates as follows:

1. **Read Data**: It reads data from the file descriptor using the `read()` system call.
2. **Buffer Management**: It manages a dynamic buffer to store incoming data.
3. **Line Extraction**: It extracts a line from the buffer each time it is called.
4. **Return Value**: The function returns a pointer to the line read, or `NULL` if the end of the file is reached.

## Memory Management

Proper memory management is crucial in C programming. The **Get Next Line** project emphasizes:

- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Using `malloc` to allocate memory for buffers.
- **Memory Deallocation**: Ensuring all allocated memory is freed to prevent leaks.
- **Static Variables**: Understanding how static variables retain their values between function calls.
